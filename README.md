# rust-winapi-example
In this example I am recreating a C++ notepad app in Rust by using the WinAPI. The C++ source "mypad" can be found here: https://github.com/genuinelucifer/mypad.

For now only a windows appears where you can write some text. In the future, the File and Edit should be functional and the rest is still in early developement.

Installation
---
To run this program, you need to download the files and extract it. Then run from your directory where you saved the files with

```rust
cargo run
```
and it should appear a window.
